= Synopsis =

Registers the platform MXBean in !WebSphere's MBean server and optionally adds a JRMP JMX connector.



= Known issues and limitations =

  * The platform MXBeans are not secured. A user who is able to connect to the !WebSphere MBean server will have access to all operations of these MBeans (even if he is not in the `monitor` or `operator` administrative role).
  * The JRMP JMX connector should not be enabled on an administrative agent (deployment manager or node agent) because it is affected by the same flaw as the JSR-160 RMI connector described in JmxClientConnector.
