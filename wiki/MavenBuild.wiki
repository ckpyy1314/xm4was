#summary Building using Maven

= Prerequisites =

  * A local installation of !WebSphere 7.0.
  * Maven 3.

= Load !WebSphere bundles into the local Maven repository =

!WebSphere uses the same OSGi runtime (Equinox) as Eclipse. Therefore maven-eclipse-plugin can be used to install the OSGi bundles of the !WebSphere runtime into the local Maven repository so that they will be available during the build:

{{{
mvn eclipse:to-maven -DeclipseDir=<was_install_dir>
}}}

`<was_install_dir>` is the WAS 7.0 installation directory (e.g. `/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer`). Note that this command must *not* be executed from the XM4WAS source directory. Instead it should be executed from any directory that doesn't contain a `pom.xml` file.
