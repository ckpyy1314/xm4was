#summary Release notes.

= 0.3.1 (not yet released) =

 * Solved issue #5.
 * The extended logging service has been improved:
   * It is now able to identify the source of log events emitted by unmanaged threads.
   * It formats (or attempts to reformat) stack traces into a more readable form (that is also more suitable if there is a limit on the log message size).
 * Added PMI metrics to measure the !VmSize and VmRSS values found in `/proc/<pid>/statm`.

= 0.3.0 =

 * Added a PMI module that provides statistics about !WebSphere's ZIP file cache.
 * Added a statistic to the class loader monitor PMI module that provides information about the resource request cache.
 * The PMI statistics can now be visualized in the performance viewer in the admin console. This already worked for stand-alone servers, but not on the deployment manager in a Network Deployment cell.

= 0.2.0 =

Adds MBean security:
 * The platform MXBeans are now secured (and require monitor or operator role, depending on the method).
 * The JRMP JMX connector now integrates with !WebSphere's security system (authentication and authorization). Note however that SSL is not yet supported.
