#summary jmx-client-connector

= Synopsis =

Connects a standard JMX client to a !WebSphere server using the protocols (RMI or SOAP) supported by the !AdminClient API.

= Rationale =

There are two ways supported by IBM to connect to a !WebSphere server using JMX:
  * Using the proprietary !AdminClient API. This API supports multiple protocols, in particular RMI/IIOP and SOAP.
  * Using the JSR-160 RMI connector which implements the standard JMX API. This connector uses a different protocol (namely the protocol defined by JSR-160), although the underlying communication protocol is still IIOP (when connecting to a !WebSphere server).

This means that it is not possible to connect a standard JMX client (i.e. a client that only uses the JMX API and no vendor extensions or proprietary APIs) to !WebSphere using any protocol other than JSR-160.

There are a couple of issues with that:
  * 
  * 

In addition, all connectors (including !AdminClient) require setting up a couple of property files. This is even more difficult on Sun JREs.
